                    <p>Hazel is a year-old yellow Labrador retriever that enjoys long walks
                        and playing catch (in or out of the water). She has a lot of energy,
                        so she gets restless if she does not have enough exercise. Hazel loves
                        meeting new people and seeing old friends. She likes to jump on people,
                        but she is friendly and does not mean any harm.
                        <span class="read-more-text">Hazel will eat anything and everything. Like most Labrador retrievers,
                            she loves food and will eat things that are not actually edible. Some
                            of the things that Hazel has chewed on include hand towels, blankets,
                            Apple Airpods, and Halloween decorations. She also loves to eat human
                            food such as lettuce.</span>

                <p>When Daisy isn’t busy slaying all of the evil snakes trying to attack us (Pictured Above), you can usually find her
                    annoying her older sister Marina, getting super hyper at completely random times, or relaxing in our backyard making
                    sure she keeps out all of the intruders (squirrels)
                    <span class="read-more-text">One of Daisy’s favorite things to do is beg to go on a walk, and then once we’re about half way done with the walk
                    she likes to lay down and refuse to keep going. She then loves being carried all the way back from said walk, and
                    the process will repeat again later in the day.</span>

                <span class="read-more-text">As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep in his dog bed and watch Netflix with his

        <div class="read-more-container">
            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches
                that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he
                doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills
                in chasing them.
                <span class="read-more-text">At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to
                    release all of his energy. He will
                    place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a
                    lot
                    of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</span>

            <p>Bear is a lazy, food-loving dog that is sometimes playful. His favorite activity is lying in the sun on his side and
                lounging. He enjoys playing with his toys and loves to fetch them when you throw them, but eventually, he gets bored
                and just stops fetching them and lays down.
                <span class="read-more-text">Bear is also scared of a lot of things. He doesn’t like water (showers and even rain)
                    or getting his nails clipped,
                    and he’s sometimes even so lazy that he’ll just stop walking and sit down until you turn around and go back
                    home.</span>

            <p>Jojo is a 14 year old dog that has grown up with me. He’s a Lhasa-Apso which is a breed from Tibet that’s known to be a
            watchdog. Funny enough, Jojo acts exactly like a watchdog. He likes to spend his days sitting next to a window looking
            and barking at people passing by. He is only a watchdog though, as he gets scared very easily.
                <span class="read-more-text">His favorite thing in life is food and his favorite foods are sweet potatoes and naan. He loves walks as well, however
                he will not go outside if it’s raining or if there’s a lot of snow on the ground. He’s taken some old blankets and
                pillows we had to make his own bed. He’s also trilingual, able to understand English, Hindi, and Japanese.</span>
