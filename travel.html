                <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and provides an
                opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the world's
                active geysers.
                    <span class="read-more-text">These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists. Every year visitors injure
                    themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals. You can see examples of people making bad decisions

                transformed into a vibrant cosmopolitan center, particularly due to the construction of the Eastern Chinese Railway by
                Russian engineers.
